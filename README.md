Some [Lua](http://www.lua.org) extensions for [MoneyMoney](https://moneymoney-app.com), the awesome personal finance application for the Mac.

Please see [MoneyMoney's extensions page](https://moneymoney-app.com/extensions) for how to install these, and maybe write some of your own (it's easy).

### CategorySums

Sums up the currently displayed transactions by category.

### ExportCategories

Exports all categories in the system.
Caveats:
* only those that have been used at least once will be exported
* first remove all filters so that all bookings are displayed.
